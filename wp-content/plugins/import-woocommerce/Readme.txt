* Map your import file headers with Product fields.

7. How to include images within the content? 
Inline images in the content can be included using shortcodes. The images in the shortcode need to be uploaded in a zip folder containing images with the exact names mentioned in the shortcode.

8. Why isn't the import button enabled?
